# Description
Today, I created a page similar to Instagram's login page for testing purposes, aiming to make it as close to the original version as possible. This was created for testing and may have some minor issues, which you can help improve during its development. :)

The languages used in this project are solely HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. Esteemed developers can find out about the collaboration conditions from the "Contribute" section (lower down on this page).

**By the way, this is solely for educational purposes, so please don't use it for any malicious activities.:)**

## Contribution
Firstly, let me say that any help, even if it's not perfect, is welcome. However, in your own code, you must adhere to certain conditions so that we can develop this project as smoothly and effectively as possible : 

### requirements
- **Code cleanliness ,**
- **Code simplicity ,**
- **Avoidance of heavy images and content ,**
- **Code dynamism and avoiding unnecessary code ,**
- **Avoid using unnecessary and heavy libraries.**
- **Using languages and frameworks used in the project.**

#### 1- Code cleanliness : 
In the first stage, you should write clean code and add necessary comments where required to make it easier for other developers to understand. 

#### 2- Code simplicity : 
Try to avoid introducing complexity into your code as much as possible. This also relates to using clean code practices, which, if followed, naturally avoids unnecessary complexity.

#### 3- Avoidance of heavy images and content : 
To prevent the project size from increasing unnecessarily, avoid using heavy content such as large images, videos, GIFs, etc., as much as possible.
**However**, if absolutely necessary, you can use very limited and lightweight animated (video, GIF, etc.) and non-animated images.

#### 4- Code dynamism and avoiding unnecessary code:
Write your code as dynamically as possible and avoid unnecessary code that simply increases size and introduces performance issues.

#### 5- Avoid using unnecessary and heavy libraries: 
Try to avoid heavy and unnecessary libraries that are not essential for the project and do not justify their use in terms of size and utility.

#### 6- Using languages and frameworks used in the project:
Try to avoid changing languages or frameworks in your project unless absolutely necessary. For example, refrain from replacing Bootstrap with Tailwind CSS 
**unless there's a serious need and it significantly improves your code.**

#### *final word*
The main goal of these guidelines is to prevent your code from becoming bloated and excessively large. However, if following these rules leads to improving the quality of your code and project, you can deviate from them and implement the best type of code. .
